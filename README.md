## ‚úèÔ∏è Adding New Scenarios

### 1. Create Scenario JSON File

Create a new file in the `scenarios/` directory following this structure:

```json
{
  "id": "scenario-002",
  "metadata": {
    "title": "Your Scenario Title",
    "description": "Brief description of the conflict",
    "category": "communication|workload|performance",
    "difficulty": "beginner|intermediate|advanced",
    "estimatedTime": "X-Y minutes"
  },
  "characters": {
    "player": { "name": "You", "role": "Your Role" },
    "character1": { "name": "Name", "role": "Role", "description": "Description" }
  },
  "nodes": {
    "start": {
      "type": "scene",
      "content": {
        "title": "Scene Title",
        "text": "Scene description and dialogue",
        "speaker": "narrator|character_name"
      },
      "choices": [
        {
          "id": "choice_1",
          "text": "What the user sees",
          "strategy": "collaborating|compromising|competing|accommodating|avoiding|active_listening",
          "nextNode": "next_node_id"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Update Scenario Index

Add your scenario to `scenarios/scenario-index.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "scenario-002", 
  "title": "Your Scenario Title",
  "category": "communication",
  "difficulty": "beginner",
  "unlocked": true,
  "file": "scenarios/scenario-002.json"
}
```

### 3. Test Your Scenario

1. Refresh the application
2. Your scenario should appear on the welcome screen
3. Test all decision paths and ensure choices lead to valid nodes
4. Verify feedback and learning outcomes are clear
